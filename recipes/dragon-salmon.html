    <h1>Dragon Salmon</h1>

    <h2>Cook's Note':</h2>
        <p>
            Aundair is the breadbasket of Eberron's Khorvaire, and the Aundair River is famous for the seafood that half-elven anglers bring back to the markets of Fairhaven. Their traditional preparation of the enormous salmon that spawn in that river, like much else in Aundair, relies heavily on sauces: in this case a butter and dark wine reduction. The aristocracy would sample only a tiny fillet before moving on to further courses, but in simpler households, a single dragon salmon could feed a family. After their fish, the locals would turn to a cremfel, a thin pancake stuffed with rich cream and slices of fresh fruit.

            <h3>Ingredients per 4 persons:</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>1/2 pounds skin-on salmon fillet, pinbones removed if necessary, cut crosswise into 4 equal pieces, and blotted dry

                    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme</li>
                <li>2/3 cup fruity, medium-bodied red wine, such as Pinot Noir, Côtes du Rhône, or Zinfandel</li>
                <li>1/3 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh chives for garnish</li>
             </ul>
             <h3>How to cook:</h3>
             <p>

                Preheat the oven to 200°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.
                
                Sprinkle the salmon lightly with salt and pepper.
                
                In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the salmon flesh-side down, leaving at least ¼ inch of space around the pieces, and cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms of the fillets start to turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip the fillets skin-side down, and cook, again undisturbed, until they are no longer translucent on the exterior and are firm when gently pressed, about 3 minutes for rare or 4 minutes for medium. Transfer the salmon to a heatproof plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to keep warm.
                
                Wipe out the skillet, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and melt it over medium-low heat. Add the shallot, thyme, and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the shallot softens, about 1 minute. Add the wine and broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring the mixture to a simmer, occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue simmering until reduced by about two-thirds, 6 to 8 minutes longer, adding any accumulated salmon juices midway through. Adjust the heat to low, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, ¼ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. And stir constantly while the butter melts and incorporates into the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Pour or spoon the sauce over or around the salmon, sprinkle with the chives, and serve hot.
