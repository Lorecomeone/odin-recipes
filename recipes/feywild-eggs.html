    <h2>Cook's Note':</h2>
        <p>
            Feywild eggs take well to all sorts of additions, including vegetables such as sautéed bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, or scallions, and meats such as crumbled cooked bacon, thinly sliced or crumbled cooked sausage, or sautéed diced ham steak. Whichever ingredients are added, use no more than 2 cups and make sure they are cooked and seasoned in the skillet before adding the eggs.
            Make sure the skillet you choose is oven-safe to 400°F.
            </p>
            <h3>Ingredients per 4 persons:</h3>
             <ul>
                <li>9 eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/3 cup finely chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil, dill, mint, tarragon, lovage or celery leaves</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>5 ounces Fontina, Colby, Monterey Jack, Havarti or Gouda cheese</li>
             </ul>
             <h3>How to cook:</h3>
             <p>

                Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.
                
                In a bowl, beat together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, herbs, salt, and a few grinds of pepper until uniformly blended.
                
                In a 10-inch nonstick, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Pour in the egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the edges begin to set and bubbles begin to appear in the center, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the diced cheese evenly over the eggs, transfer the skillet to the oven, and bake until the center is set and the frittata has puffed, about 14 minutes.
                
                Gently run a flexible nonstick spatula around the edges of the frittata to loosen it and ease it onto a serving plate. Let cool for about 15 minutes, cut into wedges, and serve warm or at room temperature.
